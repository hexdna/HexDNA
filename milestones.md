### Brief Description

HexDNA is a visual and semantic identity layer that bridges Web2 and Web3 through .dna names and dynamic glyphs. It allows users to unify all their social handles (Twitter, Lens, YouTube, etc.) under one on-chain identity, represented both as a readable name and a procedurally generated visual glyph.

Our mission is to help non-crypto-native users easily access Web3 by offering an intuitive identity system, making their first interaction with decentralized apps as seamless as possible.

## Project Description

### Problem Statement

Navigating Web3 is complex for non-technical users. Wallets, ENS, protocols — it's often overwhelming. Users lack a friendly way to connect their existing Web2 identities to Web3, making onboarding and identity consistency difficult.

### Solution

HexDNA offers:

* **.dna usernames** tied to social handles
* **Procedural glyphs** visually encoding identity
* **Aggregation Layer** to unify Web2/3 profiles
* **Future integrations** with Web3 social platforms

Everything is open source, starting centralized (for simplicity), then moving to decentralized Web3 infrastructure (Polygon or Solana).

### Existing Work

We already have:

* Live landing page at [https://hexdna.carrd.co/](https://hexdna.carrd.co/)
* Functional user registration form integrated with Airtable (via Tally)
* Branding, visual design, and early mockups
* Social traction (1.5k+ followers across platforms)

### Community Benefits

HexDNA lowers the barrier of entry to Web3 by offering a familiar Web2-like onboarding experience. It enables users to bring their Web2 identity into Web3 without needing deep technical knowledge. Furthermore, DAOs and platforms can use HexDNA as an identity layer for governance or voting.

Our commitment is to keep all code open-source and reusable for others building identity or aggregation tools.
